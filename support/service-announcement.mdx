## Overview

We're excited to share that **Hexus is joining Harvey AI**. As part of this transition, Hexus services will continue to be provided until **April 20, 2026**, after which we will be shutting down the services.

We want to ensure a smooth transition for all our customers. Below are the key changes and answers to frequently asked questions.

## Key Changes

1. **Hexus is no longer taking new sign-ups** - New account registrations have been disabled.
2. **Existing customers can continue to use Hexus, free of charge** - All existing customers can continue using Hexus on their current plans at no cost until April 20, 2026.
3. **All charges have been paused** - Your account and credit cards will not be charged for services. We will continue to honor your Hexus subscription and features free of charge until April 20, 2026 or the date of cancellation, whichever is earlier.
4. **Data Handling**
   - All customer data will be retained until April 20, 2026
   - Data export tools will remain fully available through this date
   - After April 20, 2026, all customer data will be permanently deleted.
