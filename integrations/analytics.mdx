## Google Analytics

Hexus provides tracking for the following critical events across all Hexus flows:

1. **Page Views:** Capturing when users view specific flows and product videos hosted  by Hexus.
2. **Steps Viewed:** Tracking when users navigate to and view individual steps within a Hexus flow.
3. **Steps Clicked:** Recording user interactions such as clicks in a Hexus flow.

These events will be structured to provide meaningful data within your Google Analytics 4 property, allowing for detailed analysis of user engagement and progression through your product.

### **Integration Setup: Enabling Your Google Analytics Tracking**

To activate this integration, Hexus requires specific configuration details from your Google Analytics 4 property.

#### **1. Providing Your Google Analytics Measurement ID (Basic Tracking)**

For fundamental client-side tracking of Page Views, Steps Viewed, and Steps Clicked, you will need to provide your Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID. This ID directs all client-side events from Hexus to your specific GA4 property.

**Action Required:** Please provide your Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID on the Integrations page within the Hexus app at the following link: https://app.usehexus.com/integrations

**How it Works:** Once your Measurement ID is configured, the Hexus application will dynamically initialize its client-side analytics to send these events directly to your designated Google Analytics 4 property. This ensures that all browser-based interactions are captured and attributed to your GA4 (Google Analytics) account.

#### **2. Providing Your Google Analytics Measurement Protocol API Secret (Advanced Tracking)**

For advanced analytics tracking, such as precise conversion rate measurement and reliable capture of initial page views from server-side rendered pages, we will utilize the Google Analytics 4 Measurement Protocol. This server-to-server communication method offers enhanced accuracy and resilience against client-side limitations like ad-blockers. To enable this, you must provide an API Secret from your Google Analytics 4 property.

**Action Required:** Please generate an API Secret within your Google Analytics 4 property and provide it to us.

**Instructions to Obtain Your API Secret:**

1. Log in to your Google Analytics 4 account.
2. Navigate to the Admin section (usually found in the bottom-left corner).
3. In the "Property" column, click on Data Streams.
4. Select the relevant Web data stream for your Hexus integration.
5. Under the "Google tag" section, find and click on Measurement Protocol API secrets.
6. Click the "Create" button to generate a new API secret.
7. Copy the generated API Secret string.
8. Enter this API Secret in the Hexus integrations page. Your dedicated Hexus account manager can enable the integration for you.

**How it Works:** With your Measurement ID and API Secret, the Hexus backend will be able to send server-side events (e.g., initial page views for server-rendered pages, or conversion events completed on the server) directly to your Google Analytics 4 property. This ensures that your analytics data is comprehensive and accurately reflects user activity, even for events that originate outside the client's browser. We will ensure that these server-sent events are correctly attributed to user sessions by including necessary identifiers like client_id and session_id from user cookies.

### Event Details 

Here’s a breakdown of the event names and parameters we plan to send.

- **Page Views:**
  - **Event Name:** page_view
  - **Parameters:** page_location (full URL), page_title (page title), client_id, session_id, engagement_time_msec (for server-side).
  - **Mechanism:** Initial page views on server-rendered pages will be sent via GA4 Measurement Protocol. Subsequent client-side navigations will be tracked via [getanalytics.io](http://getanalytics.io).
  - **Sample Payload:**

```
