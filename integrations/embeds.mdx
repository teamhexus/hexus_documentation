## 1. Intercom

Hexus videos can be downloaded as MP4 and added to your Intercom articles. However, you can embed Hexus videos as iframes into Intercom’s custom answers.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Messenger App**:
   - Log in to the Intercom Developer Hub.
   - Set up a new Messenger app in the Canvas Kit using the Sheets mode. This allows you to embed iframes within the Messenger.
2. **Configure the App**:
   - Use the provided documentation for Canvas Kit to configure your iframe settings. This will involve specifying how your Hexus videos are loaded within the Messenger window.
3. **Publish and Install the App**:
   - Publish the Messenger app and install it into your customer's Intercom workspace.
4. **Add to Workflow**:
   - In the Intercom workspace, go to the custom answers section.
   - Add the Messenger app to the workflow using the “Send an app” action.
   - Users will interact with Hexus videos directly within the Messenger window via the iframe.
5. **Test and Refine**:
   - Ensure everything works seamlessly by testing the integration in different scenarios and refine as needed.

For detailed implementation, refer to the Intercom Developer Hub and [Canvas Kit documentation](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/getting-started/build-an-app-for-your-messenger/sheets-app).
