Hexus directly integrates with Zapier, allowing leads captured from your demo to be sent to any third-party app.

### a. How to integrate

1. Click on "Integrations" in the left-hand menu of your Hexus account.
2. Choose the Zapier integration and click on the "Connect" button.
3. You will be provided with an API key, which is only displayed once. Make sure to copy this key, as you will need it to connect the Hexus app within Zapier.
4. In your Zapier account, create a new Zap and select Hexus as the trigger app. When prompted, paste the API key you copied from Hexus to establish the connection.
