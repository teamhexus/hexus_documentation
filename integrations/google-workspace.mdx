Hexus is your all-in-one collaborative platform to create demos, videos, guides, and more.

With our Google Workspace integration, you can now supercharge collaboration directly within Docs, Sheets, and Slides.

**How it works:**

1. Simply paste any existing Hexus Flow, Multiflow, or Showcase link into your Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides.
2. Hexus will automatically convert the link into a smart chip — making your documents more interactive and contextual.

**What you can do with it:**

1. Hover over the smart chip to see a rich preview of the Hexus content without leaving your document.
2. Collaborate seamlessly by sharing and discussing product demos directly inside your Google Workspace.

Make your documents actionable and visually richer for internal teams and external stakeholders.

This integration ensures that your Hexus content stays embedded naturally into your workflow — boosting efficiency, context, and collaboration.
