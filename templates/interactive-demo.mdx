<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is it different from a regular product demo video?">
    While a standard demo video is linear and passive, interactive demo videos allow users to make choices, explore features at their own pace, and interact directly with elements in the video (like buttons, tabs, or hotspots).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title=" Do I need technical skills to build interactive elements in Hexus?">
    Not at all. Hexus provides a **drag-and-drop interface** with pre-built interactive components, making it easy to build without coding.
