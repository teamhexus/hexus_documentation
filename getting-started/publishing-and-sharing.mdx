<Tip>
  **Hexus Tip:** Use the Embed function to make the most of Hexus. Embedding keeps your published content in sync with the editable version, so it is much easier to keep your content up-to-date.

## Publishing Drafts

Any edits on Hexus templates are saved as drafts. To save changes, you need to publish the draft before sharing.

To discard a draft you can simply revert back to the last saved version by clicking on 'Discard draft.'

## Sharing options

Hexus offers a variety of sharing options such as:

1. **Embed (Recommended):** Hexus tours can be embedded inside anything that supports iframes such as Webflow, Notion, Coda, Intercom, Zendesk, Jira, Confluence, and more.
2. **Export:** Download Hexus templates as MP4, GIF, HTML, PDF, PowerPoint, or images. You can also copy them into Google Docs, Email, Word, Zendesk, and more as HTML, Markdown, or plain text.
3. **Share as link:** You can share a template as a link and control access (public or restricted).

You can track all the pages that have an embedded flow. To track, add the URL in the reference link field, then copy the iframe embed code.

Any updates made to the Hexus flow will update everywhere it is published.
