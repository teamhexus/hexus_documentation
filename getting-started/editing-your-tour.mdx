## Recording Background Audio or Video for a Tour

<Note>
  Available on **Enterprise** Plan
</Note>

Hexus supports recording one continuous video or audio clip across the entire tour flow, making it easier to maintain consistency and streamline narration.

**Where to Find It**

<div style={{ position:"relative",paddingBottom:"calc(52.12%)",height:0,width:"100%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.usehexus.com/embed/Background_Audio_Video_on_Hexus __41f6deb1-7f2e-4dde-beb0-6b38023f5313" style={{ position:"absolute",border:"none",width:"100%",height:"100%" }} loading="lazy" allowFullScreen title="Hexus Flow" />

This feature is currently **only available in the Product Demo Video template**. To access the recording tools:

1. Open your tour in the Product Demo Video template.
2. Navigate to the **Media Toolbar**.
3. Click on the **Audio** or **Video** tab depending on your desired recording type.

**How It Works**

- You can record **one continuous video or audio** clip that plays seamlessly across the full tour.
- This eliminates the need to record separate clips for each step.
- Ideal for product walkthroughs, voiceover demos, or end-to-end guided tours.

> **Note:** This feature is exclusive to Enterprise plan users. If you're interested in upgrading, please contact your Hexus account manager.

## Adding a Step to Flow

In the tour builder, you can add a step at any point in your flow by clicking the `Add Step` button. This allows you to enrich your tour with various types of content or interactivity, such as images, videos, forms, and more.

Each step type helps improve user engagement and guides your viewers through a more compelling and interactive experience.
