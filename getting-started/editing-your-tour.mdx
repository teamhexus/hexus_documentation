## Recording Background Audio or Video for a Tour

**_(Available on Enterprise Plans)_**

Hexus supports recording one continuous video or audio clip across the entire tour flow, making it easier to maintain consistency and streamline narration.

### Where to Find It

<div style={{ position:"relative",width:"100%",paddingTop:"56.25%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.usehexus.com/embed/Background_Audio_Video_on_Hexus¬†__41f6deb1-7f2e-4dde-beb0-6b38023f5313" title="Adding Background Audio & Video in a Hexus flow" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%" }} />

</div>

This feature is currently **only available in the Product Demo Video template**. To access the recording tools:

1. Open your tour in the Product Demo Video template.
2. Navigate to the **Media Toolbar**.
3. Click on the **Audio** or **Video** tab depending on your desired recording type.

### How It Works

- You can record **one continuous video or audio** clip that plays seamlessly across the full tour.
- This eliminates the need to record separate clips for each step.
- Ideal for product walkthroughs, voiceover demos, or end-to-end guided tours.

> **Note:** This feature is exclusive to Enterprise plan users. If you're interested in upgrading, please contact your Hexus account manager.

## Adding a Step to Flow

In the tour builder, you can add a step at any point in your flow by clicking the `Add Step` button. This allows you to enrich your tour with various types of content or interactivity, such as images, videos, forms, and more.

> üîÑ **Note:** The term "page" has been replaced with **step** to align with product terminology.

Each step type helps improve user engagement and guides your viewers through a more compelling and interactive experience.

<div style={{ position:"relative",width:"100%",paddingTop:"56.25%" }}>

</div>

Here, you can import steps from other Hexus flows, upload your media, record your desktop, or record from our Chrome extension.

**1. Upload Images** - Add static visuals by uploading PNG, JPG, or GIF files from your computer. These can be used for showcasing product screenshots, diagrams, or branded graphics.

**2. Upload Videos** - Enhance your step with pre-recorded videos (MP4, MOV, etc.). Ideal for demo reels, walkthroughs, or testimonial clips.

**3. Copy Steps from Existing Flows** - Reuse steps from another flow. This saves time when you want to maintain consistency across multiple tours or reuse onboarding sections.

**4. Add a Title Slide** - Introduce a section or provide context using a clean title slide. Include a headline, subheading, and optional image to create a cover or transition slide.

**5. Add a Form Slide** - Collect input from your viewers directly within the tour. Use this to gather feedback, signups, survey data, or email addresses.

**6. Record Screen or Camera as Video** - Capture your screen or webcam in real-time. This is perfect for personalized messages, live product demos, or troubleshooting guides.

**7. Capture a New Image Using Chrome Extension** - Use the Hexus Chrome Extension to grab screenshots of your app or website instantly and embed them directly into a step.

**8. Add an AI Avatar (Coming Soon)** - Personalize your flow with a lifelike AI presenter who can deliver scripted or dynamic content. Coming soon\!

**9. Import Stock Images** - Search and insert royalty-free images from a built-in stock photo library to enhance visual appeal.

## Player and step settings

Additionally, we support adjusting the iframe under ‚ÄúPlayer Settings‚Äù toolbar for accessibility, responsiveness and other settings such as:

1. **Closed Captions:** This is available on the Growth & Enterprise plan. You can generate a transcript if your flow has audio.
2. **Play in loop:** By default, the interactive tour or video will not play in a loop. To enable autoplaying in a loop, turn the toggle on in the step settings toolbar.
3. **Background Music:** You can select one of our preset background music options. Enterprise plans support adding your own background music.
4. **Aspect ratio:** You can update the aspect ratio for your flows by adjusting the width and height, and clicking Update.
5. **Watermark:** Hiding watermark is only available on our paid plans. Enterprise plan holders can add your own watermark.
