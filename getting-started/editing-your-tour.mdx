## Recording Background Audio or Video for a Tour

**_(Available on Enterprise Plans)_**

Hexus supports recording one continuous video or audio clip across the entire tour flow, making it easier to maintain consistency and streamline narration.

**Where to Find It**

<iframe src="https://app.usehexus.com/embed/Background_Audio_Video_on_Hexus __41f6deb1-7f2e-4dde-beb0-6b38023f5313" title="Adding Background Audio & Video in a Hexus flow" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"400px" }} />

This feature is currently **only available in the Product Demo Video template**. To access the recording tools:

1. Open your tour in the Product Demo Video template.
2. Navigate to the **Media Toolbar**.
3. Click on the **Audio** or **Video** tab depending on your desired recording type.

**How It Works**

- You can record **one continuous video or audio** clip that plays seamlessly across the full tour.
- This eliminates the need to record separate clips for each step.
- Ideal for product walkthroughs, voiceover demos, or end-to-end guided tours.

> **Note:** This feature is exclusive to Enterprise plan users. If you're interested in upgrading, please contact your Hexus account manager.

## Adding a Step to Flow
