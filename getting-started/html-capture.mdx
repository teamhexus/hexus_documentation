Hexus makes it super simple to capture HTML from any webpage while recording your interactions. This powerful feature lets you document web interfaces, preserve page states, and create editable HTML copies for all your GTM needs.

### Quick Tour

<div style={{ position:"relative",paddingBottom:"calc(54.06%)",height:0,width:"100%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.usehexus.com/embed/777d49c1-9135-4a0b-a248-beb33c4b9d04?refid=" style={{ position:"absolute",border:"none",width:"100%",height:"100%" }} loading="lazy" allowFullScreen title="Hexus Flow" />

</div>

### 1. Recording a new HTML Flow

To get started with capturing your web application's HTML structure, first, you'll need to access the Hexus Chrome extension from your browser toolbar.

<img
  src="/images/1.png"
  alt="1 Pn"
  title="1 Pn"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"91%" }}
/>

1. Click on the **Hexus extension icon** in your Chrome browser's toolbar
2. Look for and click the **Capture HTML** option from the available recording modes
3. The extension will initialize and prepare to start recording your web page

Once you've selected this option, Hexus is ready to begin capturing both your interactions and the underlying HTML structure of the pages you visit. You'll notice the extension icon changes to a step counter indicating that HTML capture mode is active.

### 2. Navigate Through Your Web Application While Recording

Now comes the fun part - simply use your web application as you normally would! Hexus works quietly in the background, automatically capturing everything you need.

During this recording phase:

- **Navigate naturally** through your application - click buttons, fill forms, or browse different sections
- **Hexus automatically records** each interaction you make with the page
- **The page HTML** is captured alongside your actions, preserving the exact state of each element
- **No manual intervention needed** - just focus on demonstrating the workflow you want to capture

This intelligent recording system ensures that every click, every form field, and every dynamic element on your page is properly documented along with its HTML structure. Whether you're capturing a simple static page or a complex web application with multiple interactive elements, Hexus handles it all seamlessly.

### 3. Stop the Recording When You're Done

After you've navigated through all the pages and elements you want to capture, it's time to stop the recording and save your work.

<img
  src="/images/3.png"
  alt="3 Pn"
  title="3 Pn"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"87%" }}
/>

1. Return to the **Hexus Chrome extension** by clicking its icon again
2. Locate and click the **stop button** in the extension interface
3. The recording will automatically save to your Hexus account

The stop button is prominently displayed in the extension window, making it easy to end your recording session whenever you're ready. Don't worry about stopping at the perfect moment - you can always edit your capture later!

### 4. Review and Edit Your Captured HTML

Once you stop the recording, Hexus automatically opens your captured content for immediate review and editing.

<img
  src="/images/4.png"
  alt="4 Pn"
  title="4 Pn"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"93%" }}
/>

What happens next:

- A **new browser window** automatically opens with your recording
- You'll see your **captured HTML** displayed exactly as it appeared during recording
- The interface provides **editing tools** to modify and enhance your capture
- All your interactions are preserved and can be **replayed or edited** as needed

### Making the Most of Your HTML Capture

Your captured HTML is now ready for various uses:

1. **Documentation** - Create accurate documentation with real HTML examples for your customers
2. **Personalized Sales Demo** - You edit your HTML captures, replacing text, images and more components for personalized sales demos
3. **Marketing** - Embed on your landing pages to give users a real feel of your product
4. **Training materials** - Build interactive tutorials using actual page structures
