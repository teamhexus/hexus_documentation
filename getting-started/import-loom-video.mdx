You can easily import Loom videos into Hexus to turn them into interactive product demos, onboarding guides, or training walkthroughs. Whether you're uploading via the **Scratch Page** or using **Video to Flow**, Hexus gives you the flexibility to either embed Loom videos directly or convert them into a fully interactive Hexus Flow using Hexus AI.

<Tip>
  **Hexus Tip:** Use Loom imports to repurpose existing content; especially for onboarding, support, or product tutorials without having to re-record anything.

At this point you can choose to convert this video into:

- **Hexus Flow** - This allows you turn your loom recording into different slides. You can then edit this as you edit any Hexus flow, making advanced [editing changes](https://support.hexus.ai/getting-started/editing-your-tour) to your video
- **Continue as Video** - If you do not require extensive changes to the existing video, use this to add a script for your AI voiceover or AI Avatars. You can also record your own video and audio for your video. For a detailed guide on this, read [here](https://support.hexus.ai/getting-started/create-from-scratch).

<Tip>
  Converting into a Hexus Flow takes a few minutes. For quicker results, choose 'Continue as Video' and simply add your script.

### **Ways to use Loom videos in Hexus**

You can use imported Loom videos in two ways:

#### **1. As a video step**

Embed the Loom video as a single step within an existing Hexus Flow. Great for walkthroughs, feature callouts, or support explanations.

#### **2. Convert to a full Hexus Flow**

Let **Hexus AI** analyze the Loom video and break it into interactive steps automatically. You can then:

- Add hotspots, captions, and CTAs
- Split the content into scenes
- Customize the experience like any other Hexus Flow
