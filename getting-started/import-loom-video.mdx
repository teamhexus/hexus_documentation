You can easily import Loom videos into Hexus to create interactive product demos, onboarding guides, or training walkthroughs. By using the **Convert Videos and Images into Flows** feature, Hexus gives you the flexibility to either embed Loom videos directly or convert them into fully interactive Flows using AI.

<Tip>
  **Hexus Tip:** Use Loom imports to repurpose existing content; especially for onboarding, support, or product tutorials without having to re-record anything.

   5. Your flow will appear in your dashboard within a few minutes. We’ll send you an email or notification once it’s ready.

This feature is useful when you want to turn a long-form Loom explanation into an interactive experience with clickable elements and step-by-step guidance.

Here's an interactive demo:

<div style={{ position:"relative",width:"100%",paddingTop:"56.25%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.usehexus.com/embed/a0295160-f0eb-4168-9aa9-097ad31af99e?refid=" title="Design, styles & image editing for Hexus tours" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%" }} />

</div>

### **Ways to use Loom videos in Hexus**

You can use imported Loom videos in two ways:

#### **1. As a video step**

Embed the Loom video as a single step within an existing Hexus Flow — perfect for walkthroughs, feature callouts, or support explanations.

#### **2. Convert to a full Hexus Flow**

Let **Hexus AI** analyze the Loom video and automatically break it into interactive steps. You can then:

- Add hotspots, captions, and CTAs
- Split the content into scenes
- Customize the experience like any other Hexus Flow
