You can use the Video Recording mode on the Chrome Extension to capture screen activity as a single video. Choose to record a browser tab, a specific window, or your entire screen to create clear and focused video content.

<Tip>
  **Hexus Tip:** Keep your videos concise and focused (ideally under 2 minutes) to retain viewer attention.

### **Recording your screen as a video**

To record a screen using the [Hexus Chrome Extension](https://support.hexus.ai/getting-started/extension):

<img
  src="/images/image.png"
  alt="image.png"
  title="image.png"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"38%" }}
/>

- Click on the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar.
- Select **“Record a video”** from the available options.
- Choose the recording area:
  - **Current Tab** – Captures only the tab you're currently viewing.
  - **Window** – Records an entire browser window.
  - **Entire Screen** – Captures everything on your screen, including other windows or applications.

Once you’ve selected your preferred option, the recording will begin automatically after a short countdown.

- Once you are done recording your screen, click on '**Stop Recording**' on your Chrome extension 

  <img
    src="/images/image(93).png"
    alt="Image(93) Pn"
    title="Image(93) Pn"
    className="mx-auto"
    style={{ width:"46%" }}
  />

### **After recording**

Once the recording is stopped:

- The video is saved and processed in your dashboard.
- You can now click on the "Edit" button 

![Image(94) Pn](/images/image\(94\).png)

- Now you can choose to [customise your video](https://support.hexus.ai/getting-started/editing-your-tour), add [AI voiceovers](https://support.hexus.ai/advanced-editing/AI-Voiceovers),[ AI Avatars](https://support.hexus.ai/advanced-editing/AI-Avatar) and more from our editor\!
- You can preview, [publish and share](https://support.hexus.ai/getting-started/publishing-and-sharing) the video directly.

### **Best practices**

- For videos longer than 2 minutes, the Chrome Extension automatically records in **2-minute chunks** to ensure performance and reliability.
- **Close unnecessary tabs** to avoid distractions and ensure smooth performance.
- **Test before sharing** to confirm audio, video quality, and what’s visible.
- **Use a headset** if recording with voice for clearer audio.
