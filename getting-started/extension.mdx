## 1. Screen capture

When recording, the Chrome extension captures your Chrome tab every time you click on the screen. You can capture content cross-tab, cross-window as long as it is in the Chrome browser. When you stop recording, the steps are put together with smooth cursor movements.

## 2. Video capture

To record typing and scrolling actions as video steps, you have to be on Starter plans or above. If the actions are longer than 5 seconds, then they will be recorded as video steps with your Chrome mouse cursor.

## 3. Replace

To replace a certain step in your flow, you can use our “Replace” option available in Step settings. More about Replace [here](/advanced-editing/refresh-beta).

## 4. Refresh

Hexus offers browser automation to re-record your flows or test for stale flows when they go out of date. More about Refresh [here](/advanced-editing/refresh-beta).

## 5. HTML Editor

You can edit page copy before or during recording a flow with Hexus. This is great especially for data clean up or personalizing messaging. To edit page copy, enable any of our paid plans.
