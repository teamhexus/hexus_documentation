    You may generate AI avatar previews as many times as possible to see how an avatar may appear and sound. The final avatar videos are rendered after you **publish** the flow. Weâ€™ll notify you in app and on email as soon as your Hexus flow is ready with final renderings of animated AI avatars.

    This is a simple 3 step process:

    1. Select the step you want to change the AI avatar on and click on 'Remove media' to remove the existing avatar on your final video.
    2. Make any edits, changes you want to make to the speech, select your new avatar and 'Generate a Preview'.
    3. Once youâ€™re satisfied with the new Avatar preview, simply publish the flow again.
