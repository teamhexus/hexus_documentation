The Showcase builder now offers flexible viewing options with the addition of Switch View functionality. Users can toggle between two distinct layouts:

- **Grid View**: Displays items in a tile-based layout, allowing users to see multiple pieces of content simultaneously for easy comparison and browsing.
- **Playlist View**: Presents items in a sequential list format, ideal for when users need to focus on content in a specific order or narrative flow.

This enhancement gives users more control over how they interact with and present their content in Showcases.

1. Ensure all your flows are set to public for seamless access.
2. Use clear, descriptive titles for your sections and demos.
3. Regularly update your Demo Center with your latest and most relevant content by using the “Sync with Flows” button.
