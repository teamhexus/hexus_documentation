The Hexus AI Image Editor makes it super simple to transform any image directly within your flowâ€”no external tools needed. Let's walk through how you can guide your customers to use this powerful feature.

<div style={{ position:"relative",paddingBottom:"calc(53.71%)",height:0,width:"100%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.usehexus.com/embed/09597cf1-e99e-4083-99e0-344046b5db4d?refid=" frameBorder="0" loading="lazy" width="100%" height="100%" allowFullScreen style={{ position:"absolute" }} title="Hexus Flow" />

</div>

## Navigate to Your Hexus Flow and Access the AI Image Editor

First, you'll need to open the Hexus flow containing the image you want to edit. Once you're in the flow editor, look for the **AI Image Editor** icon in the edit tab.

<img
  src="/images/1.png"
  alt="1 Pn"
  title="1 Pn"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"81%" }}
/>

1. Open your existing Hexus flow or create a new one
2. Navigate to the step containing the image you want to edit
3. Make sure you're in the **Edit tab**
4. Locate and click the **AI Image Editor** icon above the selected step

## Enter Your AI Editing Prompt

This is where the real transformation happens. You can describe changes just like you're talking to a designer.

<img
  src="/images/2.jpeg"
  alt="2 Jpe"
  title="2 Jpe"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"85%" }}
/>

Here's how to craft effective prompts:

1. Type a clear, descriptive prompt in the text field
2. Be specific about what you want to change (e.g., "Replace the sunset view with an ocean view" or "Make the background blurry")
3. Include details about colors, lighting, or style if needed
4. Click the **Edit Image with AI** button to process your request

<Tip>
  **Pro Tips:**

  - Use action words like "replace," "add," "remove," or "change"
  - Mention specific elements you want to modify
  - Include style preferences (modern, vintage, professional, etc.)
  - Keep prompts concise but detailed enough to guide the AI
</Tip>

## Review the AI-Generated Edits

Once the AI processes your request, you'll see the edited version in the preview window. This is your chance to ensure the changes match what you envisioned.

<img
  src="/images/3.jpeg"
  alt="3 Jpe"
  title="3 Jpe"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"83%" }}
/>

Take a moment to:

1. Compare the edited image with your original vision
2. Check that important elements are preserved correctly
3. Verify the overall quality and style meets your standards
4. Consider if any additional adjustments might improve the result

Remember, you can always try different prompts if the first result isn't quite right!

## Applying Your Edits

Happy with the results? Great! Now it's time to finalize your changes. You have two options here, and it's important your customers understand both:

<img
  src="/images/4.png"
  alt="4 Pn"
  title="4 Pn"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"87%" }}
/>

### To Apply the Edits:

1. Click the **'Apply'** button to replace your original image
2. The AI-edited version will immediately replace the original in your flow
3. The change is saved automatically to your Hexus flow
4. You can continue editing other elements or move to the next step

<Note>
  Once you click **Apply**, the original image is replaced in your current flow step. If you need to preserve the original, consider duplicating the step first or saving a backup of your flow.
