While Hexus can seamlessly record most web interactions, capturing content from other browser extensions (like Apollo or similar tools) can be challenging due to certain Chrome limitations. However, here are a few effective workarounds to ensure you can still capture the full context of your demos:

### **1. Use Chrome Extension Shortcuts**

To quickly capture browser extension content:

- Navigate to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` in your Chrome browser.
- Set up custom shortcuts for capturing screenshots or activating specific features.
- Use these shortcuts during your Hexus recordings to seamlessly capture extension interactions.

### **2. Record Your Screen or Use the Video-to-Flow Converter**

If capturing live extension interactions isn't feasible:

- Use Hexus's built-in screen recording feature to record your entire screen, including the extension UI.
- Alternatively, record your demo separately or reuse an existing video, then convert it to an interactive flow using the Hexus video-to-flow converter. This approach was used effectively in John’s demo on the Conceal Home page.

### **3. Append to an Existing Hexus Recording**

For more comprehensive demos:

- First, capture your Hexus recording using the extension for the primary content.
- Then, use the “Record your screen” option to add in the browser extension parts.
- You can also upload relevant images or video clips to provide full context.

By combining these methods, you can effectively showcase your complete workflow, including third-party extensions, within your Hexus flows. For more tips and best practices, check out our [support portal](https://support.hexus.ai) or reach out to our team for personalized guidance.
