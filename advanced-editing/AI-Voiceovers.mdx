  **Pro Tips:**

  - Keep the speaker and voice settings (speed, stability & similarity) same across all steps for consistent voiceovers.
  - Punctuations around beginning and ending of a sentence influence the voice for the whole sentence. Minimize the usage for a consistent voice across all steps.
  - Perfect the pronunciations of specific words like business terms by using our [pronunciation dictionary](https://support.hexus.ai/advanced-editing/pronunciation-dictionary) (English only)
</Tip>
