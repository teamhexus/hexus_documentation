## Advanced Page Editing

<Card title="How to Use Regular Expressions" icon="searchengin" href="/advanced-editing/using-regular-expressions">
  Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, are sequences of characters that form search patterns. They are used for matching strings within text and are a powerful tool for searching, replacing, and manipulating text.

### üîÑ Advanced Replacement Rules

**Advanced Replacement Rules** let you define multiple sets of search-and-replace logic to dynamically modify HTML content on a page. This is especially helpful when you need to clean up, customize, or standardize content across various web flows without changing the original website source code.

#### üß† What Are Replacement Rules?

Replacement rules use pattern matching (often with **regular expressions**) to search for specific text or HTML elements and replace them with something else. These rules can:

- Swap out sensitive information
- Personalize text (e.g., replacing ‚Äúuser‚Äù with a real name)
- Standardize inconsistent content formats (like phone numbers or dates)
- Remove unwanted UI elements during flow recording

#### ‚úÖ Why Use Multiple Rule Sets?

In the past, users could only apply a **single rule set** using our Chrome extension. Now, with Advanced Replacement Rules available **in-app**, you can:

- Create and manage **multiple configurations** tailored to different use cases or projects
- **Switch between rule sets** based on the flow you're recording or editing
- Maintain cleaner, more professional recordings by controlling how content appears

#### üë• Collaboration Made Easy

- **Available on Starter\+ plans**
- **Team Sharing** is supported on **Growth plans**, so teams can collaborate using shared configurations
- Ideal for teams working across departments, clients, or different use cases
