## Advanced Page Editing

<Tip>
  **How to Use Regular Expressions**

  Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, are sequences of characters that form search patterns. They are used for matching strings within text and are a powerful tool for searching, replacing, and manipulating text.

</Tip>

### **Advanced Replacement Rules**

**Advanced Replacement Rules** let you define multiple sets of search-and-replace logic to dynamically modify HTML content on a page. This is especially helpful when you need to clean up, customize, or standardize content across various web flows without changing the original website source code.

### What Are Replacement Rules?

Replacement rules use pattern matching (often with **regular expressions**) to search for specific text or HTML elements and replace them with something else. These rules can:

- Swap out sensitive information
- Personalize text (e.g., replacing “user” with a real name)
- Standardize inconsistent content formats (like phone numbers or dates)
- Remove unwanted UI elements during flow recording

### What are rule sets and how to use them ?

**Rule sets **are a collection of replacement rules for quickly applying editing rules to page, such as anonymizing emails, phone numbers etc to maintain privacy in your recorded product tours.

</div>

**How it works**

1. By default, the chrome extension creates and updates the rule sets as you create and edit them via the **Hexus Content Editor**
2. To manage or change the rule sets that you want to use for a specific recording, or share with your team,head over to [Chrome Settings Management Page](https://app.usehexus.com/profile?tab=content%20editor%20management%20tool) in the Hexus web app.
