## Localize content with unique urls

To create localized variants for your product tours, with language specific urls follow these steps:

<div style={{ position:"relative",width:"100%",paddingTop:"56.25%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.usehexus.com/embed/6015823b-b0d8-4c1d-bc35-d06582dfe068" title="Hexus Localization" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%" }} />

</div>

Contact us for translating video or audio steps or in your Hexus tours.

For users on a starter plan, while you cannot generate unique URLs with standard locale codes, you can still translate your flows into one of our 15 languages and share it as a unique link.
