## Localize content with unique urls

To create localized variants for your product tours, with language specific urls follow these steps:

<div style={{ position: "relative", width: "100%", paddingTop: "56.25%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.usehexus.com/embed/fc683b56-7751-4c73-abcb-7dc6da6484b5?refid=" title="Hexus Localization" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }} />
</div>

Contact us for translating video or audio steps or in your Hexus tours.

For users on a starter plan, while you cannot generate unique URLs with standard locale codes, you can still translate your flows into one of our 15 languages and share it as a unique link.
